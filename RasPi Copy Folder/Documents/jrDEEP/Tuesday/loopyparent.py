#Let's say you haven't finished your homework yet:
homework = "unfinished"

#Then the annoying parent won't be happy!
#They will keep bugging you to see if you did your homework.
#The bugging loop...
while homework == "unfinished":
	#ask if your homework is done (hint: use annoyingparent.py for help)
	#_if_ it is done, change homework to "finished"
	#otherwise, keep looping!!
	#Make sure to keep all your looping code indented like this!

#What does the parent say when you finish your homework?
print "Good job, now go do the dishes!"
